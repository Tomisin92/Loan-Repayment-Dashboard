Loan Repayment Dashboard 
The Loan Repayment Dashboard provides a detailed overview of loan disbursement and repayment behavior, allowing for data-driven decision-making. It tracks a total loan portfolio of $471,600, segmented by factors such as education level, gender, and age group. Key insights include:

Loan Distribution: The majority of loans are held by customers with a Bachelor's degree or higher, accounting for over 55% of the total loan amount. Males represent 84.56% of the total loan pool.
Payment Behavior: 60% of customers pay on time, while 40% have late payments, with an average of 36 days past due. The dashboard tracks detailed loan statuses, showing that 60% of loans are paid off and 20% are in active collections.
Demographics of Loan Payers: Late payers are predominantly male and within the 18-39 age group, and education plays a role in payment behavior, with lower rates of late payments among those with advanced degrees.
Loan Terms & Repayment: Loans with shorter terms (7 years) have higher on-time payment rates (95.24%) compared to longer-term loans. The dashboard also provides insights into repayment trends over time, showing loan amounts received by month, quarter, and year.
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for monitoring loan performance, identifying at-risk loans, and understanding the demographic breakdown of repayment patterns.
